Purpose:

Create a client-server application for Windows.

Algorithm:

 Clients send to the server random integer numbers from 0 to 1023.

 The server receives and stores these numbers in a binary tree using them as

unique keys.

 Upon a client&#39;s request, the average of squares of the numbers including the

newly received number is calculated and sent back to the client as a response.

 A client receives this value and generates a new random number and then again

sends it to the server and so on.

 Every N seconds store all the items from the binary tree into a file in the binary

format

Tests:

 Output all the processes into console and the application&#39;s log file.

 Run about 20 – 30 clients and keep the program working about 10-20 minutes.
